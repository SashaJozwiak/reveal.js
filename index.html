						<p>
							There are 2 types of backlogs: Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Product Backlog</b> — this is a complete list of all the work, the implementation of which we will get the final product.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Sprint Backlog</b> — this is a list of work that the team has identified and agreed with the Product Owner for the next reporting period (sprint). Tasks in the sprint backlog are taken from the product backlog.

							<b>Sprint</b> — a period of time (2-4 weeks) that is taken to complete a limited list of tasks (Sprint backlog), which are unchanged during the sprint, must be completed on time and demonstrated to the Product Owner. 
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
						<b>Sprint planning</b> — this is a meeting where everyone is present (team, scrum master, product owner). During this meeting, the Product Owner prioritizes the tasks they would like to see completed at the end of the sprint. The team evaluates over time how much of the desired they can accomplish. The result is a list of tasks that cannot change during the sprint and must be fully completed by the end of the sprint.

					<h2>What first?</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>The <b>product owner</b> compiles the project backlog — this is a list of requirements for functionality, ordered by their degree of importance, to be implemented. The items in this list are called backlog items. </p>
						<p>The <b>project backlog</b> is open for editing for all participants in the scrum process. The entire project backlog is divided into sprints for each of which a sprint backlog is formed.</p>
